# Password Update Implementation Plan

## Overview

Currently, the `updateUser` function allows updating the password directly without verifying the current password. We need to modify this to require verification of the current password before allowing a password change.

## Requirements

1. Add two new fields to the password update process:

   - `currentPassword` - The user's current password for verification
   - `newPassword` - The new password to set

2. Verify the current password matches before allowing the update
3. Apply the same validation to the new password (minimum 8 characters)
4. Update the password only if verification succeeds
5. Return appropriate JSON responses for all scenarios

## Implementation Steps

- [x] **Step 1:** Modify the `updateUser` function to handle the new password update flow

  - [x] Remove the direct password update logic
  - [x] Add new logic to check for currentPassword and newPassword fields
  - [x] Implement verification of the current password
  - [x] Apply validation to the new password
  - [x] Update the password only if verification succeeds

- [x] **Step 2:** Test the implementation
  - [x] Test with correct current password and valid new password
  - [x] Test with incorrect current password
  - [x] Test with valid current password but invalid new password (too short)
  - [x] Test without providing current password but with new password

## Expected Behavior

1. If `currentPassword` and `newPassword` are both provided:

   - Verify `currentPassword` matches the stored password
   - If verification succeeds, validate and update to `newPassword`
   - If verification fails, return an error

2. If only `newPassword` is provided (without `currentPassword`):

   - Return an error requiring current password verification

3. If only `currentPassword` is provided (without `newPassword`):

   - Ignore the password update part and proceed with other updates

4. If neither is provided:
   - Proceed with other updates (if any)

## JSON Responses

1. Successful password update:

   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "User updated successfully",
     "data": { ... } // User data without password
   }
   ```

2. Incorrect current password:

   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "message": "Current password is incorrect"
   }
   ```

3. Invalid new password:

   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "message": "New password must be at least 8 characters long"
   }
   ```

4. Missing current password:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "message": "Current password is required to update password"
   }
   ```

## Implementation Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**: The password update feature has been successfully implemented with current password verification.

**Note**: This implementation plan file can be safely deleted now that the feature has been implemented.
