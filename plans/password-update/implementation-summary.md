# Password Update Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

The password update feature has been successfully implemented in the user controller. The implementation now requires verification of the current password before allowing a password change, enhancing security.

## Changes Made

1. Modified the `updateUser` function in `backend\controllers\user.controller.js`:
   - Replaced the single `password` field with `currentPassword` and `newPassword` fields
   - Added verification of the current password using bcrypt.compare
   - Added validation for the new password (minimum 8 characters)
   - Added appropriate error responses for various scenarios

## Security Improvements

1. **Verification Required**: Users must now provide their current password before changing to a new one
2. **Proper Validation**: The new password is validated for minimum length requirements
3. **Secure Hashing**: Passwords continue to be securely hashed using bcrypt

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with various scenarios:

- Correct current password with valid new password
- Incorrect current password
- Valid current password with invalid new password (too short)
- Missing current password but with new password
- Updating other fields without changing password

## API Usage

To update a user's password, the client should send:

```json
{
  "currentPassword": "user's current password",
  "newPassword": "user's new password"
}
```

To update other fields without changing the password, simply omit the password fields.

## Note

This implementation aligns with security best practices by requiring verification of the current password before allowing password changes.
