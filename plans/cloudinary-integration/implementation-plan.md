## Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk                       | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cloudinary API rate limits | High   | Implement request throttling and proper error handling                   |
| Large file uploads         | Medium | Set file size limits and validate before uploading                       |
| Security vulnerabilities   | High   | Validate file types, use signed uploads, implement proper authentication |
| Increased response times   | Medium | Optimize image processing, consider async processing for large files     |
| Cloudinary service outages | High   | Implement fallback storage option, add retry logic                       |

## Fallback Strategy

If issues are encountered with Cloudinary:

1. Store a reference to local file uploads temporarily
2. Implement a queue system for failed uploads to retry later
3. Provide option to revert to previous image if update fails

## Testing Requirements

1. Verify successful upload of different image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
2. Confirm proper storage of Cloudinary URLs in user profiles
3. Test image update scenarios (replacing existing images)
4. Validate error handling for various failure scenarios
5. Check performance with different file sizes

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Users can successfully upload profile and cover images
2. ✅ Images are properly stored in Cloudinary and URLs saved in user profiles
3. ✅ Existing images are properly replaced when updated
4. ✅ System handles error scenarios gracefully
5. ✅ Performance remains acceptable with image upload operations

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED**: The Cloudinary integration for user profile updates has been successfully implemented.

**Note**: This implementation plan file and related documentation can be safely deleted now that the feature has been implemented.
